CVTC Ride Share
=============

This is the CVTC Ride Share Application for Agile Programming.<br>
After our first sprint, we have decided to have one person in charge of the Master branch.<br>
<b>Fork the repository, work on whichever feature you claimed, when completed and fully tested, send a pull request for it to be merged.</b>


<br>
How to update your fork to the current working copy (Vandise/CVTCRideShare):<br>
1.) clone your fork and cd into that directory<br>
2.) checkout a new branch with the command: git checkout -b vandise-master master <br>
3.) pull down the working master repo: git pull https://github.com/Vandise/CVTCRideShare.git master <br>
---- Note: you may get merge conflicts, type git status to see which files may need changes.
4.) if you need to merge your changes, open the file in an editor and merge them (use the github tutorials if you need help)<br>
5.) Once you have your merge conflicts fixed type: git add myConflictedFile or git add . <br>
6.) Then commit the file(s): git commit <br>
7.) Switch to your forks master branch: git checkout master <br>
8.) Merge the vandise-master branch with your fork: git merge vandise-master master <br>
9.) Push to your fork: git push origin master <br>
10.) Your fork is now up to date with the master repo (Vandise/CVTCRideShare) <br>
